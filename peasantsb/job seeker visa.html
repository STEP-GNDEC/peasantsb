    <h1>JOB SEEKER VISA</h1>
    <p>A job seeker visa is a type of visa that allows individuals to enter a foreign country for the primary purpose of seeking employment opportunities. This type of visa is typically temporary and is granted to individuals who are actively looking for employment, but it does not grant them the right to work immediately. Instead, it offers them a specific period, often several months, during which they can search for a job and secure employment legally.
    </p>
    <p>Key features of a job seeker visa include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>*Non-Work Visa:*</b> A job seeker visa is not a work permit. It is intended for individuals who want to explore employment opportunities in a foreign country and eventually secure a job.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*Limited Duration:*</b> Job seeker visas are usually granted for a limited period, typically ranging from three months to one year, depending on the country. During this time, applicants are expected to actively search for a job.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*No Requirement for a Job Offer:</b> Unlike many work visas that require a job offer from an employer, a job seeker visa typically does not require applicants to have a job offer before applying. However, some countries may have specific eligibility criteria.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*Employment Transition:*</b> Once an individual secures a job while on a job seeker visa, they often need to convert their visa into a work or employment visa to legally work in that country.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*Eligibility Criteria:*</b> Eligibility criteria for a job seeker visa can vary from one country to another. Common requirements include having sufficient funds to support oneself during the job search period and demonstrating relevant qualifications and skills.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>*Job Search Period:*</b> The visa holder is expected to actively search for employment during the specified period. Some countries may require applicants to provide evidence of job applications or attend job interviews.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's important to note that the specific regulations and requirements for job seeker visas can vary significantly from country to country. Therefore, individuals interested in obtaining a job seeker visa should consult  with us for destination country for precise information on eligibility, application procedures, and any associatedÂ fees.</p>
