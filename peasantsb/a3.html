    <h1>AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING</h1>
    <p>Automotive Engineering is a field that deals with planning and assembling vehicles and rail vehicles. Automotive designing in Germany or in some other nation besides is a subset of mechanical engineering and works in consonance with various fields of designing like electronic and electrical designing, IT, and data frameworks which praise the general assembling of a car vehicle.</p>
