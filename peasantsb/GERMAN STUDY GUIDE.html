    GERMAN STUDY GUIDE <br><br>
Education System <br><br>
The German education system is different in many ways from the ones in other countries and the classes are conducted in German. Public universities are financed by the government and do not charge tuition fees or just charge a small amount of money as Administration Fee at the start of academic every year. Private universities in-contrast are financed by the fees paid by students and these can be quite expensive. Germany has a larger number of public universities than private ones. German law says that education should be offered to everyone and everyone should be able to afford adequate education. Therefore, in some areas, the tuition fee was abolished, while in other areas it’s very small. <br><br>

Education in Germany is in some aspects more theoretical than in other countries, with professors spending more hours in lectures. At the end of every term the students get grades for their final examination and for speeches, assignments and practical projects. Depending on the subject the composition of these parts can differ. Practical education can also be offered during internships which are an obligation in some subjects. <br><br>
Popular student destinations: The top universities in Germany are Heidelberg University, Technical University of Munich, Free University of Berlin, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and the Humboldt University of Berlin (in no particular order). Berlin is the centre of all the renowned academic institutes. Most of the best colleges in the country are situated in cities like Munich, Baden-Wurttemberg, Frankfurt, and Heidelberg. The number of Indian students in Germany has grown robustly, registering a growth of 13% and in 2017, Germany’s universities enrolled 13,740 Indian students as per 2015-2016. Engineering, Business Studies, IT/Computing, Tourism & Hotel Management, and Visual Communications are the popular courses Indian students pursue in Germany. <br><br>

Safety in Germany: Germany is generally a safe country, and while crime in Germany exists, it is rather low-scale. Violent crime in Germany is rare. Most Germans don’t feel that their safety is threatened by terrorism. The need for security measures in public spaces has also increased in Germany in recent years. As a result, security cameras have become common in public areas and in buses, local trains, and trams. Signs indicate the presence of video monitoring. <br><br>

Weather: German summers are hot and the winters are cold and snowy, but rains are unpredictable and common during all seasons. The average winter temperature is 3°C and in summers it is 22°C. Maximum temperatures commonly reach -10°C in winter and 35°C in the summer months. The country is divided into 16 states and has an exceedingly varied landscape, so it is difficult to generalize the weather for the whole country. <br><br>
