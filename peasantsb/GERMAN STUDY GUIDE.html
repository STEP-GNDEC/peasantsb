    GERMAN STUDY GUIDE <br><br>
Education System <br><br>
The German education system is different in many ways from the ones in other countries and the classes are conducted in German. Public universities are financed by the government and do not charge tuition fees or just charge a small amount of money as Administration Fee at the start of academic every year. Private universities in-contrast are financed by the fees paid by students and these can be quite expensive. Germany has a larger number of public universities than private ones. German law says that education should be offered to everyone and everyone should be able to afford adequate education. Therefore, in some areas, the tuition fee was abolished, while in other areas it’s very small. <br><br>

Education in Germany is in some aspects more theoretical than in other countries, with professors spending more hours in lectures. At the end of every term the students get grades for their final examination and for speeches, assignments and practical projects. Depending on the subject the composition of these parts can differ. Practical education can also be offered during internships which are an obligation in some subjects. <br><br>
Popular student destinations: The top universities in Germany are Heidelberg University, Technical University of Munich, Free University of Berlin, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and the Humboldt University of Berlin (in no particular order). Berlin is the centre of all the renowned academic institutes. Most of the best colleges in the country are situated in cities like Munich, Baden-Wurttemberg, Frankfurt, and Heidelberg. The number of Indian students in Germany has grown robustly, registering a growth of 13% and in 2017, Germany’s universities enrolled 13,740 Indian students as per 2015-2016. Engineering, Business Studies, IT/Computing, Tourism & Hotel Management, and Visual Communications are the popular courses Indian students pursue in Germany. <br><br>

Safety in Germany: Germany is generally a safe country, and while crime in Germany exists, it is rather low-scale. Violent crime in Germany is rare. Most Germans don’t feel that their safety is threatened by terrorism. The need for security measures in public spaces has also increased in Germany in recent years. As a result, security cameras have become common in public areas and in buses, local trains, and trams. Signs indicate the presence of video monitoring. <br><br>

Weather: German summers are hot and the winters are cold and snowy, but rains are unpredictable and common during all seasons. The average winter temperature is 3°C and in summers it is 22°C. Maximum temperatures commonly reach -10°C in winter and 35°C in the summer months. The country is divided into 16 states and has an exceedingly varied landscape, so it is difficult to generalize the weather for the whole country. <br><br>

<h1>Lifestyle tips</h1> <br><br>
Germany is a multicultural country although it has a homogenous bearing. Customs and traditions of people of various backgrounds maintain their distinct identity and so do foreigners residing there. Germans believe in maintaining a globalized outlook. The Germans are very fond of socializing and like to indulge in interesting conversations. One can take part in several festivals that are celebrated with great fervor throughout the year. Living expenses in Germany are quite affordable so those visiting or planning to settle there permanently need not to worry about having to spend too much. <br><br>

<h1>Indians living in Germany</h1> <br><br>
The population of Indian students living in Germany is nearly 13,740 as per 2015-2016. Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Cologne, and Munich are the cities where most Indian students go to study. <br><br>

The landscape of Germany’s higher education is very diverse. It offers thousands of degree programs, more than 300 institutions and lots of different credentials and degrees. This implies that you can choose a program that caters to your needs and interest from the vast variety of courses offered by this country. You can take a research-oriented program at a Universitat (university) or a more practice-focused course at a Fachhochschule which is University of Applied sciences or an artistic program at one of the Kunst-, Film-, or Musikhochschulen (colleges of art, film or music). Many programs and subjects are offered by all three types of institutions, which widen your choice even further. If you already hold a degree, then you can choose to enter a postgraduate or doctoral program for advanced qualifications. <br><br>

<h3>Why to Study in Germany? </h3><br><br>
The list of the top 100 higher education institutions of the world includes the names of 6 German Universities. Most importantly the courses offered in Germany can be easily afforded by the citizens of other countries also. The inclusion of the oldest of the universities of Germany in the list of top universities around the globe bears a testament to the high quality of education that is imparted here. Institutions like Heidelberg University, Leipzig University, Rostock University, LMU Munich, etc. are some of the oldest and the best regarded institutes of this country. <br><br>

The general entrance requirement for university is Abitur. It is a qualification which is based on the continuous assessment of the candidates’ performance in the last few years of his school and in his final examinations. However, this is not a uniform criterion for the entire federal area. All the 16 states of this nation have their own rules and regulations regarding educational programs. But one thing which is common to all these states is the dual system of education which consists of theoretical and practical knowledge of the subjects. Here the universities pay a lot of attention to research work along with teaching. <br><br>
