    <h1>AEROSPACE ENGINEERING</h1>
    <p>By the continuous growth of the air traffic is making the field of the air transport promising field and the ones who wanting to pursue their profession in Aerospace Engineering in Germany. Aircraft Fabrication or even crew cabin in the flight or at air terminals as it is predicated that by the year of 2025 the air traffic in the Europe will be doubled from now. To provide help in this growing air traffic and take special care of their assumptions, the air transport industry needs to grow itself in different angles, for example airplane fabricating, maintenance, solid engineering, crew cabin, and air terminal staff.</p>

    <p>Aerospace design in Germany has a great scope for study and research as Germany is considered as the center point of exploration in the aeronautic areas and innovation. This industry comprises of key advancements which are connected with the investigation of Earth and Solar framework, research in improving innovations that could be supported by the climate for more secure air transport which doesnâ€™t put trouble over climate by getting out GHG. Air transportation contributes 3% of air pollution starting today, which is disturbing.</p>
    <p>The German aeronautic industries are continuously innovative in the research and development of aerospcae technologies through huge funding support, which adds up to 22.9 percent of the general income earned for the development and extension of the Aerospace Industry. The German government helps in the study and research in the field of aeronautical engineering in Germany through different academic projects. This research gets a 1 billion euro grant consistently from the government. It comprises the biggest region inside the high-tech funding procedure, so students should be ready for pursuing their masters in aerospace engineering in Germany.</p>
