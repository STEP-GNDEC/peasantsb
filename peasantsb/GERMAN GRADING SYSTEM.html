    <h1>GERMAN GRADING SYSTEM</h1>
   <p> When applying for a degree at a German university it is almost one hundred percent sure that you’re
     going to submit your academic scores taken during previous education. In that case, your grades will 
     be compared to the German grading system and then after it will be assessed if you meet specific entry requirements. </p>

    <p>If you are planning to pursue your higher studies in Germany, the first thing you need to understand is the
         grading system because you have to translate your grades of your past studies according to the German grading
          system, so that you are able to apply for the courses you intend to study and to be able to understand your
           score according to the German grading system.</p>

    <p>Given below are marks in the German grading system and their translation in terms of your academic achievement</p>

  <p>1.0  –  Excellent. You have successfully completed between 90 and 100% of the material required in the exam.</p>

  <p>2.0  –  Overall very good. However, you need to work more in specific study areas.</p>

  <p>3.0  –  Good. Your achievement is satisfying, but there is room for improvement.</p>

  <p>4.0  –  Adequate.</p>

   <p>5.0  –  Sufficient to pass the exam, but very poor otherwise.</p>

   <p>6.0  –  Insufficient. You have shown insufficient knowledge to pass the exam you sat.</p>

  <p>Note that there are some universities which use a 5 point grading scale to mark their students’ academic
     achievement. If that is the case with your chosen university in Germany, here’s what every grade means: </p>

  <p>1 to 1.5 – Very good. You have successfully completed a major part of your exam, but there are some minor areas you must improve.</p>

  <p>1.6 to 2.5 – Good. You have shown decent academic performance by correctly completing a considerable proportion of your exam.</p>

  <p>2.6 to 3.5 – Satisfactory. Your performance was a bit more than sufficient and you need to work in several areas.</p>

  <p>3.6 to 4.0 – Sufficient. You have reached the minimum score to pass the exam, but your performance leaves much to desire.</p>

   <p>4.1 to 5 – Fail. Your performance lies behind the minimum score.</p>



<h1>What is the ECTS Grade?</h1>
    <p>The acronym ECTS stands for European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System. ECTS is a common European grading framework 
        designed on the purpose of facilitating the academic exchange among EU countries.</p>

    <p>European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) is a standard method to compare and evaluate the “volume of 
        learning based on the defined learning outcomes and their associated workload” for pursuing higher education all across 
        the countries of the European Union and the other collaborating European nations. After the successful completion of
         studies, ECTS credit points are awarded to a student. One academic year includes 60 ECTS credits which generally 
         correspond to 1500–1800 hours of the total workload, irrespective of the standard or the qualification type.</p>
