    <h1>PERMANENT RESIDENCE</h1>
    <p>If you are working or studying in Germany, then you are likely aiming towards permanent residency, maybe even citizenship down the line. However, you can only become a German permanent resident and get a Settlement Permit if you fulfill a set of requirements.    </p>

<p>The <b>German permanent residence permit</b> known also as <b>Settlement Permit</b> and is issued only after you have lived and worked in Germany for a specified period of time â€“ usually four years, but certain visa types allow you to apply for permanent residence quicker.</p>

The period of time you have to live in Germany before you get a Settlement Permit depends on your current residential status. As such, you can become a German permanent resident:
<ul>
    <li>After four years if you are a skilled worker.</li>
    <li>After four years if you are a researcher.</li>
<li>After two years if you are a skilled worker with a German university degree or vocational training.</li>
<li>After 33 months if you are an EU Blue Cardholder. If you are an adequate speaker of the German language, you can get the Settlement Permit after 21 months.</li>
<li>After three years if you are self-employed.</li>
<li>After five years if you are a freelancer.</li>
<li>After three years if you are the family member of a German national.</li>
<li>After five years if you are in Germany as an asylum seeker or refugee. The period can be shortened to three years if you can speak German well and are able to earn your own living.</li>

</ul>
