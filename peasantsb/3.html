    <h2>SCHOLARSHIPS & FUNDINGS</h2> <br><br>
    Not only is Germany one of the cheapest study destinations in Europe, the nation also has an impeccable international reputation. <br><br>

Germany is famous for its cost-effective higher studies because the German Government provides lots of scholarships and funds to the universities to promote higher education. The German Constitution has made education free in the country though there are some universities that charge fees, but they are minimal. Getting admitted in any of the German Universities is only half the battle won, the major task is to get the scholarships or funding for the course. There are a number of options available even for the students from abroad. There are many universities which charge very less fees and that also can be funded under different schemes launched by German Government. Many institutions in Germany offer financial support to students, but the key to scholarship is to stand out. Getting financed in Germany not only requires high grades and intelligence, but also social engagement. So you have to excel in all these domains. <br><br>

There are many programs offered by German Universities which are specially meant for the international students both for graduate and post-graduate courses. It is very important to remain informed and apply early because there are thousands of applicants for each seat which is financed. In the last few years, only 3 to 5 percent of students were funded by scholarships, so you must always keep in mind to finance your studies through other mediums as well. Most scholarships offered to the students for studying in Germany include the living cost in Germany as well. Also, there are possibilities to get a work permit in Germany for part-time to earn the living expenses there. <br><br>
